title: "Because Intelligence starts with curiosity"
---

I am a **PhD Researcher in Robotics** working on foundation models and long-horizon manipulation. Most of my days are spent thinking about language-conditioned tasks and how multi-agent systems can work together. I believe that true '*intelligence*' won't emerge simply from scaling parameters, but through **System-level Intelligence**. Because of this, I want to build robust, modular systems that don't just work in a paper, but actually interact with real people on real hardware.

### Beyond the lab

For me, research doesn’t end as a paper. I’ve always been a challenger, constantly pushing myself to take ideas out of my head and into the real world. My curiosity usually starts with a 'why' or a 'it would be so cool to have that' and quickly turns into 'how can I build this?'. Whether I’m working on a robotic pipeline or a weekend side project, I’m driven by making things that are useful and grounded in the real world.

I share these experiments and thoughts on **[Curious Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/@loanbernat8145)**, my YouTube channel. It’s a place where I can be less formal, explore news ideas, and connect with people who are just as obsessed with the future of robotics as I am.

I’m always open to collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of multi-agent systems and robotic autonomy. Feel free to reach out.
