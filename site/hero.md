# Welcome to my world!

**PhD researcher** in robotics working on language-conditioned, long-horizon manipulation and multi-agent robotic systems. 

My work focuses on building real systems that can understand and interact with the world in a human-like manner.

I also share some projects on **Youtube** to make robotics and Artificial Intelligence more accessible.
