  "Research internship on reducing annotation requirements for visual object classification using generative models.",
  [86, 152],
  "Generative AI",
  [91],
  "This project was conducted during a research internship at [Silèane](https://www.sileane.com/en/).  \nDue to industrial confidentiality constraints, the code and datasets are not open-source.\n\nThe objective was to investigate whether **generative novel-view synthesis** could reduce the amount of human-annotated data required to train robust object classification models in industrial settings, where annotation is costly and time-consuming.\n\n## Problem Setting\n\nIn industrial perception pipelines, object classifiers often rely on large annotated datasets to handle variations in viewpoint, lighting, and appearance. However, collecting such datasets is expensive and does not scale well to new objects or frequent changes in production.\n\nThe core question addressed in this internship was:\n\n> *Can a model trained on a very small number of annotated images achieve strong generalization by leveraging synthetic visual variations generated by a diffusion-based model?*\n\n## System Overview\n\nThe proposed pipeline takes as input a **single annotated image of an object** and generates multiple realistic variations by modifying:\n- viewpoint,\n- lighting conditions,\n- texture appearance.\n\nDiffusion models were used to generate these variations while preserving object identity, with the goal of improving robustness to visual distribution shifts during training.\n\nThe augmented dataset was then used to train an object classification network, and its performance was compared against a baseline trained only on human-annotated data.\n\n## Technical Challenges & Design Choices\n\n- Controlling generative diversity while maintaining object identity to avoid label noise.\n- Preventing distribution drift between synthetic and real data.\n- Balancing augmentation strength to improve generalization without overfitting to artifacts.\n- Designing an evaluation protocol suitable for low-data regimes.\n\n## Outcome\n\nThe final system was able to generate up to **46 distinct visual variations** from a single annotated image.\n\nExperiments showed that, with **only a dozen human-annotated images**, the classifier reached up to **98% accuracy** on the target object classification task—significantly outperforming models trained without synthetic augmentation.\n\nThis work demonstrated the practical potential of generative models as a data-efficient alternative to large-scale manual annotation in industrial vision pipelines.",

  "Because Intelligence starts with curiosity",
  "I am a **PhD Researcher in Robotics** working on foundation models and long-horizon manipulation. Most of my days are spent thinking about language-conditioned tasks and how multi-agent systems can work together. I believe that true '*intelligence*' won't emerge simply from scaling parameters, but through **System-level Intelligence**. Because of this, I want to build robust, modular systems that don't just work in a paper, but actually interact with real people on real hardware.\n\n### Beyond the lab\n\nFor me, research doesn’t end as a paper. I’ve always been a challenger, constantly pushing myself to take ideas out of my head and into the real world. My curiosity usually starts with a 'why' or a 'it would be so cool to have that' and quickly turns into 'how can I build this?'. Whether I’m working on a robotic pipeline or a weekend side project, I’m driven by making things that are useful and grounded in the real world.\n\nI share these experiments and thoughts on **[Curious Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/@loanbernat8145)**, my YouTube channel. It’s a place where I can be less formal, explore news ideas, and connect with people who are just as obsessed with the future of robotics as I am.\n\nI’m always open to collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of multi-agent systems and robotic autonomy.
