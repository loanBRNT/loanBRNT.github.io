  "This project was developed during a research internship at Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences (Germany).\nThe objective was to design a complete robotic bartender system using a [Sawyer manipulator](https://www.rethinkrobotics.com/sawyer), integrated with a [Pepper robot](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/pepper) acting as a waiter. My focus was entirely on the Sawyer application.\n\n## System Overview\n\nI treated this as a full-stack robotics problem:\n\n- **Perception:** I trained and integrated YOLOv5 to identify bottles and cups. While being reliable under the shifting lights of a lab environment.\n- **Manipulation:** I designed the grasp sequencing to handle different bottle shapes and ensure a steady pour without \"spilling\".\n- **The Bridge (No-Code):** I built a Node-RED interface that abstracted the ROS complexity. It allowed Master’s students to \"program\" the robot for their own experiments.\n\nIt was one of my first autonomous project on a real robot. Supervisors let me explore any solution that I want and I really faced the curse of any real robots application: race conditions 🫡 and timing issues. \n\n## Technical Challenges & Design Choices\n\n- **Robust perception**: bottle and cup detection needed to be reliable under varying lighting and clutter.\n- **Grasp sequencing**: handling bottles safely while ensuring stable pouring.\n- **Human-in-the-loop coordination**: synchronizing actions with Pepper or Humans required explicit confirmation handling.\n- **Usability**: the Node-RED interface had to abstract ROS complexity while remaining expressive for students.\n\n## Outcome\n\nThe final system was able to autonomously execute drink-serving sequences, from order recognition to cup delivery, while remaining configurable through a no-code interface.\n\nThis project demonstrates my early experience with:\n- full-stack robotic systems\n- perception-driven manipulation\n- ROS-based orchestration\n- designing interfaces for non-roboticists",

  "Because Intelligence starts with curiosity",
  "I am a **PhD Researcher in Robotics** working on foundation models and long-horizon manipulation. Most of my days are spent thinking about language-conditioned tasks and how multi-agent systems can work together. I believe that true '*intelligence*' won't emerge simply from scaling parameters, but through **System-level Intelligence**. Because of this, I want to build robust, modular systems that don't just work in a paper, but actually interact with real people on real hardware.\n\n### Beyond the lab\n\nFor me, research doesn’t end as a paper. I’ve always been a challenger, constantly pushing myself to take ideas out of my head and into the real world. My curiosity usually starts with a 'why' or a 'it would be so cool to have that' and quickly turns into 'how can I build this?'. Whether I’m working on a robotic pipeline or a weekend side project, I’m driven by making things that are useful and grounded in the real world.\n\nI share these experiments and thoughts on **[Curious Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/@loanbernat8145)**, my YouTube channel. It’s a place where I can be less formal, explore news ideas, and connect with people who are just as obsessed with the future of robotics as I am.\n\nI’m always open to collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of multi-agent systems and robotic autonomy.
